# happy-stacks environment (template)
#
# Copy to `.env` (recommended) and adjust as needed:
#
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# Notes:
# - `HAPPY_STACKS_*` is the canonical prefix.
# - `HAPPY_LOCAL_*` is still supported as a legacy alias (via automatic mapping).
#
# This file is kept for tooling compatibility; the canonical template is `.env.example`.
