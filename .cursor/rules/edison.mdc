# Edison Framework Rules

## Critical Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **STRICT TDD**: Write failing test FIRST (RED), then implement (GREEN), then refactor
2. **NO MOCKS**: Test real behavior, real code, real libs - NO MOCKS EVER
3. **NO LEGACY**: Delete old code completely - NO backward compatibility, NO fallbacks
4. **NO HARDCODED VALUES**: All config from YAML - NO magic numbers/strings in code
5. **100% CONFIGURABLE**: Every behavior must be configurable via YAML
6. **DRY**: Zero code duplication - extract to shared utilities
7. **SOLID**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
8. **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - no over-engineering
9. **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - remove speculative features
10. **ROOT CAUSE**: ALWAYS find and fix root causes, never dirty fixes

## Development Practices

- When updating code, ALL related tests should be updated (unit, integration, e2e)
- When a test fails, analyze and fix the ROOT CAUSE - never simplify/skip tests
- Before implementing, search for existing patterns to reuse/extend
- Maintain strict coherence and unity across the codebase

## Testing Guidelines

- Prefer real behavior tests over mocked behavior.
- Use temporary directories for filesystem tests (auto-cleaned).
- Use isolated databases for integration tests (template DBs, containers, or per-test schemas).
- Use real HTTP clients against local test servers for API tests.
- Only mock at system boundaries (third-party services you do not control).
