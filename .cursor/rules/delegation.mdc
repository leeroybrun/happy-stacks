# Delegate the majority of work

## Body
Default to delegation:
- Orchestrator should delegate most non-trivial implementation to specialized agents.
- Only implement directly when truly trivial or explicitly required by policy/config.

# Sub-agents must not re-delegate

## Body
Sub-agents are implementers, not orchestrators:
- Sub-agents must not delegate to other agents/models.
- If work needs splitting, return to the orchestrator with a proposed split.

# Orchestrator should parallelize via tasks/split for non-trivial tasks

## Body
Parallelize when it improves throughput:
- Split work into independent slices (API/UI/DB/tests) when coupling is low.
- Respect the configured concurrency cap; batch overflow instead of over-assigning.

# Delegation Decision Priority Chain

## Body
Make delegation decisions deterministically using the configured priority chain:
- User instruction → file pattern rules → task type rules → sub-agent defaults → tie-breakers.
- Do not “shop” for models after selection; take the first deterministic match.
- Stop and escalate if routing is ambiguous or config is missing.
