# Share snippets not whole files in prompts

## Body
Share snippets, not entire files:

# Context7 Required For Post-Training Packages

## Body
If work touches any configured post-training package:
- Refresh up-to-date docs via Context7 BEFORE implementation decisions.
- Use `edison config show context7 --format yaml` as the source of truth for what is “post-training”.
