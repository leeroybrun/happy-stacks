# Implementation Report Markdown is required per round

## Body
Each implementation round must produce an implementation report Markdown file (YAML frontmatter + body) in the round evidence directory:
- Include summary, changed files, automation outputs, Context7 packages queried, follow-ups, and blockers.
- Do not invent new report paths or filenames; follow the project’s configured schema/locations.
