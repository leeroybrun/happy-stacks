# Context7 evidence markers required when post-training packages are used

## Body
When Context7 is required for a round:
- Create a `context7-<package>.txt` marker per detected package in the round evidence directory.
- Notes in task/QA text are not accepted as evidence; use marker files only.

# Automation evidence must be captured via tasks/ready

## Body
Capture automation evidence through guarded tooling:
- Use the Edison guard/runner to generate command outputs and evidence markers.
- Do not paste manual command output into docs as a substitute for evidence files.

# Preset-required command evidence must be captured

## Body
Before executing validators, ensure preset-required command evidence exists and passes for the current repo fingerprint:
- Inspect: `edison evidence status <task-id> [--preset <preset>]`
- Capture: `edison evidence capture <task-id> [--preset <preset>]`
- Evidence is snapshot-based (shared across rounds/tasks when the repo fingerprint is unchanged). Do not redirect output into files manually.

# Evidence rounds are append-only

## Body
Evidence is append-only:
- Each re-run creates a new round directory; do not overwrite previous evidence.
- Never edit old evidence outputs to “make it look green”; rerun commands.

# No Duplicate QA Briefs

## Body
Do not create duplicate QA briefs:
- Before creating a QA, search for an existing QA for the same task.
- If one exists, reuse it (move it through states), don’t create a new file.

# Create QA brief when task enters wip

## Body
Pair QA early:
- As soon as a task enters wip, create (or move) its QA brief into waiting and add both to session scope.
- Do not defer QA creation until validation time.

# QA Round History On Rejection

## Body
On any rejection:
- Append a new “Round N” section to the QA brief summarizing findings and linking evidence.
- Create a new round evidence directory; never overwrite prior rounds.

# QA waiting→todo allowed only when task is done

## Body
Promotion gating:
- QA may move from waiting → todo only when the task is in done.
- If QA is “todo” while task is not done, treat it as a state mismatch and correct it.

# Bundle Approved Marker Required

## Body
Bundle approval must be explicitly recorded:
- After ALL blocking validators approve, ensure the configured “bundle approved” marker exists in the round evidence directory.
- Promotions that require approval must fail-closed if the marker is missing or indicates not approved.

# Bundle-First Validation Policy

## Body
Always validate from a bundle/manifest first:
- Generate the bundle/manifest before launching any validator.
- Validators must review only what the bundle lists (task(s), QA, evidence paths, diffs).

# Respect validator concurrency cap and batch overflow

## Body
Respect the configured concurrency cap:
- Launch validators in parallel up to the cap.
- Batch overflow into subsequent waves; do not exceed cap “because it’s faster”.

# Validation-First Within Session Scope

## Body
Before expanding scope, prioritize validation work already inside the current session:
- Validate owned/paired QA briefs tied to tasks you already own before claiming new work.
- If any blocking validator is missing/blocked, halt and resolve before proceeding.

# Orchestrator Cannot Self-Validate

## Body
Validation must be independent:
- Orchestrator must not validate their own implementation work.
- Use separate validator roles/models where possible; do not collapse implementer + validator into one.

# Validator model binding must match config

## Body
Validator model binding is strict:
- Validators must run with the exact model binding defined by merged config (core → packs → user → project).
- If the configured model is unavailable, the run is “blocked” and must be recorded as such (do not silently substitute).

# Validator waves must run in order

## Body
Run validator waves in strict order:
- Global → Critical → Specialized (triggered).
- Do not start later waves until earlier blocking waves have completed and passed.
