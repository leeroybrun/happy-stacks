# Claude Code

This file configures Claude Code for this project.

## Entry Point

**Read the project's `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.**

This file will direct you to the appropriate constitution based on your role.

## Background Subagents + Permissions (Claude Code)

Claude Code background subagents (e.g. Task tool with `run_in_background: true`) cannot prompt for tool permissions.

If a tool call is not already allowed by `.claude/settings.json`, it will be auto-denied (often with “prompts unavailable”)
and **retry loops will never succeed**.

Hard rules:
- **Do not retry** permission-denied tool calls in a loop. Fail fast and report the exact tool + command + missing permission.
- For background work, run shell commands via `edison exec -- <command> ...` so they match the allowed `Bash(edison:*)` rule.
- If you must run direct `Bash(...)` commands that would require interactive approval, run them **in the foreground** (not background).
