# Expo / React Native Validator

## Checklist (Expo / RN)

- [ ] No web-only APIs used in native paths (e.g. `window`, `document`) unless guarded
- [ ] Navigation, storage, and permissions follow platform constraints
- [ ] No assumptions about Node APIs in the client bundle
- [ ] Metro bundling considerations (no dynamic require patterns that break Metro)
- [ ] If NativeWind is used, className usage is consistent and typed (avoid inventing Tailwind CSS web patterns)
- [ ] Changes validated via stack-scoped `happys` evidence when applicable (typecheck/lint/build/test)
