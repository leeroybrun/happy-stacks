# Task Waves (Parallelizable Waves) - Include-Only File
<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

### Task Waves (Parallelizable Waves)

Compute parallelizable “waves” from `depends_on`:

```bash
edison task waves
```

- Prefer **Wave 1** tasks for “start now”.
- Respect the configured cap (`orchestration.maxConcurrentAgents`). If Wave 1 exceeds the cap, use the printed batch suggestions (or `--json` for structured batches).
- Use `edison task relate <task-a> <task-b>` to link non-blocking “related” tasks (this influences within-wave grouping).
- If a desired todo task isn’t in Wave 1, inspect why:
  ```bash
  edison task blocked <task-id>
  ```

### Task Waves (Parallelizable Waves)

```bash
edison task waves [--json] [--cap <n>]
```

**Purpose**: Compute topological “waves” of **todo** tasks based on `depends_on`, so you can safely delegate independent work in parallel without reading every task file.

**How to use**:
- Prefer **Wave 1** tasks for “start now”.
- Respect the configured cap (`orchestration.maxConcurrentAgents`). Use `--json` only when you need structured batches for tools/scripts.
- Use `edison task blocked` for detailed “why blocked” explanations on a specific task.

### Task Waves (Parallelizable Waves)

Use `edison task waves` to compute parallelizable waves of todo tasks from `depends_on` (Wave 1 = “start now”), and respect `orchestration.maxConcurrentAgents`. Use `edison task blocked <task-id>` for “why blocked” explanations.

# Schema Design Patterns

<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

<!-- section: patterns -->
## Patterns

- Prefer stable primary keys (UUID/CUID) and keep them opaque.
- Use explicit relations with `@relation(fields:, references:)` and a deliberate `onDelete`.
- Use enums for constrained value sets.
- Add unique constraints and indexes for real query patterns (FKs + common filters + common sort keys).
- Keep nullability deliberate (nullable only when truly optional).

### Minimal illustrative schema (generic)

```prisma
model User {
  id      String   @id @default(uuid())
  email   String   @unique
  records Record[]
}

enum RecordStatus {
  ACTIVE
  INACTIVE
}

model Record {
  id        String       @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  status    RecordStatus

  userId    String
  user      User         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  createdAt DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime     @updatedAt

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([status])
}
```

### Anti-patterns

- `status String` instead of an enum for a constrained domain
- Relations without indexes on foreign keys
- Making fields required before you have a safe backfill plan

## Guideline: includes/react/component-design

# Component Design

<!-- WARNING: This file is for {{include-section:}} only. DO NOT read directly. -->

<!-- section: patterns -->
- Favor composition over inheritance; extract pure presentational pieces.
- Keep components small and focused; single responsibility.
- Co-locate tests and stories with components when appropriate.
- Use semantic HTML and descriptive props; avoid boolean prop proliferation.

- [NON-BLOCKING] Preserve context budget – load only what's needed (category: context)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Context window anxiety management (CWAM) (category: context)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Share snippets not whole files in prompts (category: context)
- [NON-BLOCKING] No manual file moves; use guarded CLIs (category: transition)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Disallow skipping states in task/QA transitions (category: transition)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Do not stop early; continue until the session is complete (category: session)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Orchestrator should parallelize via tasks/split for non-trivial tasks (category: delegation)
- [NON-BLOCKING] Close session only when no blockers remain and all scope is validated (category: session)

=== Context & Continuation ===

Keep working methodically and protect context:
- Prefer small, deterministic steps over rushing.
- Avoid pasting large logs; summarize and reference artifacts by path.
- If approaching limits, follow the project's compaction/recovery guidance.

When continuation is enabled and work remains:
- Continue iterating until Edison reports the session complete.
- Use the loop driver: `edison session next <session-id>`
- Do not stop early when work remains.
